# c-plus-plus-Projects
There are three project. Lets discuss one by one
## 1. Conversion infix postfix prefix
This project is all about making a calculator of coversion INFIX POSTFIX PREFIX
this calculator convert these combination

                                  1:Convert  infix to postfix
                                  2:Convert  infix to prefix
                                  3:Infix evaluation
                                  4:Convert  postfix to infix
                                  5:Convert  postfix to prefix
                                  6:Postfix evaluation
                                  7:Convert  prefix to infix
                                  8:Convert  prefix to postfix
                                  9: Prefix evaluation

Inside each combination their is facility to possible conversion Ex: Let choose first option,
these are possible conversion combinations of result
  1:Convert postfix to infix
  2:Convert postfix to prefix
  3:Convert postfix evaluation

 ##2. Learn Data Structure
 This project is help begineer to learn the data structure by visualization things.
There are four data structure and their different types and  some important properties are discuss.
1. ARRAY
2. STACK
3. LINKED list
4. QUEUE
For each data structure, project discuss these task
1. Searching
  (i). Linear Search
  (ii). Binary Search
2. Sorting
  (i). Quick Sort
  (ii). Merge Sort
  (iii). Bubble Sort
  (iv). Insertion Sort
3. Deletion

##3. Trafic Management System

Trafic management system project give a feel of trafic manager.
Procees of project
Firstly registered yourself then login after that game start
This project divide three part
1. Update Traffic: Enter trafic manually in all four lines and their situation
2. Start simulation: Autometicaly start simulation
3. Dispaly Generated challans:  if speed is greater then speed limit , its challan release
